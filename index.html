           <p>I have written the <b>Smooth Anchor Scrolling</b> to improve the weight of your callbacks. I was using Twitter's Bootstrap 3.0 when i wrote this and i'm surprised they haven't yet built anything in. Alas! I have written a super lightweight smooth scroll plugin free for you all to use. I have deliberately <b>not included</b> a plugin such as Scrollspy as i built this for use with Bootstrap that already has Scrollspy within.</p>

           <h1 id="section2">S2. Compatibility</h1>
           <p>Currently works well on <b>all modern browsers</b> such as recent versions of <b>Chrome, Safari, Opera, Firefox and IE10+</b>. I have also tested this on current mobile operating systems such as <b>iOS6, iOS7, Jellybean and BlackBerry's OS 10 Software</b>.</p>
           <p>Despite not being tested in previous versions of Internet Explorer i have full-faith that it will work back to <b>IE7</b> and it's predecessor as it's leveraging <b>jQuery</b> functions such as <code>.animate</code>, <code>.closest</code> and others. See the Editor view for full code. </article>
